                    <p><img src="../images/pizzaplace6.jpg" alt="Okotoks Pizza Restaurant Kitchen Area">There are no
                        short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, giving you the
                        ‘wow’
                        flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming
                        back,
                        again, again, and again.
                        <img src="../images/background-image.jpg" alt="Pizza with fresh ingredients"> We’re a small
                        but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When
                        we’re
                        not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients,
                        we’re
                        crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy.
                        <img src="../images/Pizza-Pepperoni.png" alt="Pepperoni Pizza">From hot
                        Hawaiians and classic
                        Canadians
                        to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
                        <img src="../images/owner.jpg" alt="Okotoks Pizza Owner">After watching his
                        parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland
                        learned
                        how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004,
                        Matt
                        has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the
                        mid
                        80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.
                        <img src="../images/pizzaplace3.jpg" alt="Okotoks Pizza Restaurant Exterior">Pizzas are made
                        with only the
                        freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes,
                        made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from
                        Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about
                        eating
                        it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</p>
